The whole SenseOps ([Butler family of tools](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs), together with support tools like InfluxDB, Prometheus, Grafana etc) stack is really a platform that can be configured and used in lots of different ways.  

Be curious and bold - extend the given examples and use cases with your own!
And when doing so - please consider sharing your successes (and failures..) with others, as inspiration and insight.
