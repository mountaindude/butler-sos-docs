Butler SOS is written in Node.js, which is a cross-platform programming environment.
This means most kinds of computers and servers can be used to run Butler SOS, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

Setting up Butler SOS is pretty straightforward, but you do need a working understanding of Qlik Sense admin tasks. For example, you need to export certificates from the QMC, as well as installing Butler SOS itself.
