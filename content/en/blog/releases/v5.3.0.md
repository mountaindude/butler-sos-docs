This is a minor release. The names of loaded/in-memory/active apps are now sorted alphabetically before they are stored in Influxdb. Makes it easier to scan through the list when its presented in for example a Grafana dashboard.

List of changes:

- [#101](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-sos/issues/101) Session data not correctly extracted in 5.2.0.
- [#102](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-sos/issues/102) Sort app names.
