  Running Butler SOS in Windows. Installation and configuration.
---

## Installation

In this scenario, Butler SOS will run as a Node.js app on the Windows server itself.  

### 1. Install Node.js

Any recent Node version should work fine, but if in doubt the [latest LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is usually a good idea.

### 2. Select a directory from which Butler SOS will be run

This can be pretty much anywhere, in this example d:\tools\butler-sos will be used.

### 3. Get Butler SOS

Get the desired [Butler SOS version](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-sos/releases) and extract it into the directory above.

### 4. Install Node.js dependencies

From d:\tools\butler-sos\src, run `npm i` to install the various Node.js modules used by Butler SOS. Depending on your server configuration you may get some warnings about (for example) Python not being installed, these can usually be ignored.
