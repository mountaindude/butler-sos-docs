New docs, blog and news coming to Butler SOS.

While easy to use, GitHub's standard one-page README file has once again proven to work only so far.  

After a fair bit of work we are today releasing a new docs site for Butler SOS.
Most of the info on the previously used README page has been moved to this new site.

The really good part is however that the new site has plenty of room for structured growth, allowing us to add examples, tutorials etc in a good way.

It's also easy for anyone to provide feedback - just click the "Create issue" link in the upper right corner of each page, and are taken straight to the issues section on GitHub. Easy!
