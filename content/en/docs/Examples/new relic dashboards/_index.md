In this dashboard most of the data comes from Butler SOS, but the failed reload pie chart and table at the top are created using data from the [Butler](https://butler.ptarmiganlabs.com) tool.

New Relic does not give you nearly the same level control as Grafana does, for example when it comes to fine-tuning visual details of charts, tables etc.

That can first feel a bit limiting, but as New Relic's query language is very powerful and is very well integrated in the chart editor, it's not really a problem.  
New Relic dashboards are definitely on the same level as Grafana ditto, which one to use is a matter of preference.
