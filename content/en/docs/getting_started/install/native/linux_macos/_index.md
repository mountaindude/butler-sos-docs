  Running Butler SOS in Linux and Mac OS. Installation and configuration.
---

## Installation

This scenario is identical to the [Windows scenario](/docs/getting_started/install/native/windows/), please refer to that page for details. Keep in mind that the format of file systems paths differ between Windows and Linxu/Mac OS.

## Configuration

Once again, same thing as [on Windows](/docs/getting_started/install/native/windows/).

## Stayin' alive

A Node process monitor can be used on Linux or Mac OS, just a on Windows.
Tools like [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) in fact usually work better on Linux/Mac OS than on Windows..

You can probably also use Linux' standard service layer to start Butler SOS, that has not been tested though.
